This text file will enumerate the changes between the original version and the improved version of the second practical assignment submission.

Report Changes:
- Added on each CWE chapter a "CVSS Estimado" section where I assign a CVSS estimate of the CWE, show the combination of parameters which led me to the estimate and provide a brief explanation of the choice of parameters;
- Re-interpreted the CWE-598 and CWE-200, therefore I added two new chapters, CWE-598 (chapter 6) and CWE-200 (chapter 7), and removed the old chapter CWE-598 + CWE-200 (chapter 6).
- Improved the chapter of CWE-434 (chapter 10), namely the section "10.2 Resolução da Vulnerabilidade".
